        <h1>Week 1 League News</h1>
        <p>Week 1 of the LBL is in the books and it was a success. 4 teams came out and competed. The players were a little rusty due to the long offseason, but Spencer Webb for Team Michael had a standout performance, putting up 20 of the team's 27 points, in their 27-20 win over Team Lucas. It was a tight game through out, but thanks to some clutch shots by Webb, Team Michael was able to secure the victory even in the absence of their coach, Michael Weston.  Team Jake blew out Team Trey 28-14. Jake Bransfield came up just shy of a double-double with nine points and nine rebounds. First round pick George Povemba had a shaky week 1 for Team Trey, shooting 0-9 from the field. </p>
        <p>It was a great week one and now the teams must get ready for week 2!</p>
